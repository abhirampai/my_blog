Last weekend, while immersed in Euro Truck Simulator 2, a flurry of GitHub notifications pulled me back to reality.
This sparked an idea: why not build a simple code reviewer bot powered by AI? Given its accessibility,
I decided to go with Gemini.

My journey began with a direct query to Gemini itself, asking for guidance on how to get started. It promptly provided me with the initial steps for creating a GitHub App and connecting it to a serverâ€”which I'd build later.

## Setting Up Your GitHub App
The first crucial step is to set up a dedicated GitHub App.

### Creating the Application
To begin, navigate to your GitHub profile. From the dropdown menu, select <b>Settings</b>. On the left-hand sidebar, you'll find <b>Developer settings</b>. Within Developer settings, proceed to create a new GitHub App.

## Configuring the Webhook
For local development, you'll need a way to receive webhook events from GitHub. I used [smee.io](https://smee.io) to obtain a temporary webhook URL, but `ngrok` is another excellent alternative.

For enhanced security, it's essential to provide a <b>webhook secret</b>. This secret will be used to verify the authenticity of incoming requests. You can generate a strong secret directly from your command-line interface. For instance, using Ruby:
```sh
ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(32)'
```

## Granting Permissions
Your GitHub App requires specific permissions to interact with your repositories and pull requests effectively. Configure the following permissions:

| Permission | Access |
| - | - |
| Check status | Read & Write |
| Metadata | Read only ( will be selected automatically ) |
| Pull request | Read & Write |
| Commit status | Read & Write |
| Contents | Read only |

## Subscribing to Events
Next, you need to subscribe your GitHub App to specific events that will trigger your reviewer bot. Ensure your app subscribes to these events:

| Events |
| - |
| Pull request |
| Pull request review |
| Pull request review comment |

Once your application is successfully configured, make sure to generate the private key. This `.pem` file will be automatically downloaded and is crucial for authenticating your server with GitHub.

## Building the FastAPI Server
With the GitHub App configured, it's time to build the backend server using FastAPI.

### Installing Dependencies
I prefer `uv` for package management, but you can certainly use `pip` and a `requirements.txt` file if that's your preference.

Install the necessary packages using `uv add`:
| Packages | Description |
| - | - |
| fastapi[standard] | The standard FastAPI package with core components |
| google-geniai | For interacting with the Gemini AI models |
| pydantic-settings | For managing environment variables securely | 
| pygithub | A Python wrapper for the GitHub Octokit API |
| ruff | A fast code linter and formatter |

### Setting Up Configuration
Let's start by creating a `config.py` file to handle reading sensitive information from your `.env` file:
```py
from functools import lru_cache
from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict


class Settings(BaseSettings):
    GITHUB_APP_ID: str
    GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY: str
    WEBHOOK_SECRET: str
    GEMINI_API_KEY: str
    REVIEW_LIMIT: int = 50

    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(env_file=".env")


@lru_cache
def get_settings():
    return Settings()
```

This `config.py` utilizes `pydantic-settings` to load environment variables from a `.env` file. The `lru_cache` decorator on `get_settings()` ensures that the settings are loaded only once and then cached for faster access.

### Building the Main Application
Next, we'll build the core FastAPI application logic in `main.py`:
```py
from fastapi import FastAPI

from config import get_settings
from routers import webhook


app = FastAPI(
    title="Gemini Code Reviewer",
    description="A tool to review code using Gemini",
    version="0.1.0",
    contact={
        "name": "Gemini Code Reviewer",
        "url": "https://github.com/abhirampai/gemini_code_reviewer",
    },
)

app.include_router(webhook.router) # We are using routers to handle webhook related routes.

APP_ID = get_settings().GITHUB_APP_ID
PRIVATE_KEY = get_settings().GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY
WEBHOOK_SECRET = get_settings().WEBHOOK_SECRET
GEMINI_API_KEY = get_settings().GEMINI_API_KEY

# If none of these values exist then we raise value error.
if not all([APP_ID, PRIVATE_KEY, WEBHOOK_SECRET, GEMINI_API_KEY]):
    raise ValueError(
        "Missing one or more required environment variables: "
        "GITHUB_APP_ID, GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY, GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET, GEMINI_API_KEY"
    )


@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}

```
This `main.py` sets up the FastAPI application, includes the webhook router, and performs essential environment variable checks to ensure all necessary credentials are present.

### Implementing the Webhook Router
Now, let's create the `routers/webhook.py` file to handle incoming GitHub webhook requests:
```py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Request

from utils.webhook import verify_signature, parse_webhook_payload, get_event_type
from models.pull_request import PullRequest

router = APIRouter(tags=["webhook"])


@router.post("/webhook")
async def webhook(request: Request):
    """
    Receives GitHub webhook events.
    Verifies the signature.
    Parses the payload.
    Identifies the event type.
    Runs the code review only if the payload action is opened or synchronize.
    """
    body = await request.body()
    await verify_signature(request, body)
    payload = parse_webhook_payload(body)
    event_type = get_event_type(request)
    if event_type == "pull_request":
        pull_request = PullRequest.from_github_event(payload)
        if (
            payload.get("action") == "opened"
            or payload.get("action") == "synchronize"
        ):
            print(f'Executing gemini review on pull request: {pull_request.repository["full_name"]}#{pull_request.number} ')
            commit_sha = payload.get("after")
            if commit_sha:
                print(f'Executing only on files under the commit: {commit_sha}')
            pull_request.gemini_review_request(commit_sha)
    elif event_type == "ping":
        return {"message": "pong"}
    else:
        return {"message": f"Event type '{event_type}' received but not handled."}

    return {"message": "Webhook received"}

```
This router defines the `/webhook` endpoint, which is the entry point for GitHub events. It orchestrates signature verification, payload parsing, and triggers the Gemini review process specifically for opened or synchronize pull request actions.

### Create Webhook Utilities
To support the webhook router, we'll create utility functions in `utils/webhook.py`:
```py
import hmac
import hashlib
import json

from fastapi import HTTPException, Request, status

from config import get_settings


async def verify_signature(request: Request, body: bytes):
    """
    Verifies the signature of the webhook request.
    """
    signature_header = request.headers.get("X-Hub-Signature-256")
    if not signature_header:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="X-Hub-Signature-256 header missing.",
        )

    try:
        secret_bytes = get_settings().WEBHOOK_SECRET.encode("utf-8")
        mac = hmac.new(secret_bytes, body, hashlib.sha256)
        expected_signature = "sha256=" + mac.hexdigest()
    except Exception:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_500_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            detail="Failed to calculate signature.",
        )

    if not hmac.compare_digest(expected_signature, signature_header):
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_401_UNAUTHORIZED,
            detail="Webhook signature verification failed.",
        )


def parse_webhook_payload(body: bytes):
    """
    Parses the webhook payload.
    """
    try:
        return json.loads(body)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST, detail="Invalid JSON payload."
        )


def get_event_type(request: Request):
    """
    Returns the event type of the webhook request.
    """
    event_type = request.headers.get("X-GitHub-Event")
    if not event_type:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST,
            detail="X-GitHub-Event header missing.",
        )

    return event_type
```
These utilities handle the crucial aspects of webhook security (signature verification) and payload processing, ensuring the integrity and correct interpretation of incoming GitHub events.

### Defining the Pull Request Model and Review Logic
Finally, let's create the `models/pull_request.py` file to encapsulate the pull request-related logic, including the interaction with Gemini and posting review comments:
```py
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Dict, Any
from github import Auth, GithubIntegration
from config import get_settings
from google import genai
from utils.diff_checker import find_line_info

auth = Auth.AppAuth(get_settings().GITHUB_APP_ID, get_settings().GITHUB_PRIVATE_KEY)
gi = GithubIntegration(auth=auth)
installation = gi.get_installations()[0]
g = installation.get_github_for_installation()

gemini_client: genai.Client = genai.Client(api_key=get_settings().GEMINI_API_KEY)


class ReviewComment(BaseModel):
    path: str
    body: str
    line: str


class PullRequest(BaseModel):
    id: int
    number: int
    repository: Dict[str, Any]

    @classmethod
    def from_github_event(cls, event: Dict[str, Any]):
        """
        Reads the github event and stores the attributes in pull request object.
        """
        payload = event.get("pull_request")
        return cls(
            id=payload["id"],
            number=payload["number"],
            repository=event.get("repository"),
        )

    def gemini_review_request(self, commit_ref: str = None):
        """
        Identifies the files to be reviewed and invokes create review.
        """
        repo = g.get_repo(self.repository["full_name"])
        pull_request = repo.get_pull(self.number)
        files = []
        if commit_ref:
            files = self.get_commit_files(repo, commit_ref)
        else:
            files = pull_request.get_files()
        
        self.create_review(files, pull_request)

    def create_review(self, files, pull_request):
        """
        Invokes the gemini client to review the file and sends the review as comments to github.
        """
        review_comments = []
        for file_data in files:
            review_comments_for_the_file: list[ReviewComment] = self.generate_review(
                file_data.patch
            )
            for review_comment in review_comments_for_the_file:
                line_changed = review_comment.line
                review_comment_dict = review_comment.model_dump()
                review_comment_dict.pop("line")
                review_comments.append(
                    {
                        **review_comment_dict,
                        "path": file_data.filename,
                        **find_line_info(file_data.patch, line_changed),
                    }
                )
            if len(review_comments) >= get_settings().REVIEW_LIMIT:
                break

        self.post_review_comments(pull_request, review_comments)

    def post_review_comments(self, pull_request, review_comments: list[dict]):
        """
        Submit review comments as comment to github.
        """
        pull_request.create_review(
            body="Please review the following suggestions",
            event="COMMENT",
            comments=review_comments,
        )

    def generate_review(self, file_content):
        """
        Generate gemini review and return a list of ReviewComment objects.
        """
        response = gemini_client.models.generate_content(
            model="gemini-2.5-flash",
            contents=f"""

            config={
                "response_mime_type": "application/json",
                "response_schema": list[ReviewComment],
            },

        return response.parsed
    
    def get_commit_files(self, repo, commit_ref: str):
        """
        Get commit files from commit details.
        """
        commit = repo.get_commit(commit_ref)
        return commit.files
```
This model handles initializing the GitHub and Gemini clients, fetching the relevant files for review (either the full PR diff or changes from a specific commit during a `synchronize` event), generating reviews using Gemini, and then posting those reviews as comments to GitHub.

### Adding the Diff Checker Utility
For precise line comments, we need a utility to parse diffs. Create `utils/diff_checker.py`:
```py
import re


def find_line_info(diff_text, target_line):
    """
    Identifies the line, start_line, start_side & side given the diff_text and the target line to be searched for.
    """
    lines = diff_text.splitlines()
    old_lineno = new_lineno = 0
    hunk_old_start = hunk_new_start = 0

    for line in lines:
        if line.startswith("@@"):
            match = re.match(r"^@@ -(\d+)(?:,\d+)? \+(\d+)(?:,\d+)? @@", line)
            if match:
                hunk_old_start = old_lineno = int(match.group(1))
                hunk_new_start = new_lineno = int(match.group(2))
            continue

        content = line[1:] if line else ""
        if line.startswith(" "):
            if content == target_line:
                return {
                    "line": new_lineno,
                    "start_line": hunk_new_start,
                    "start_side": "RIGHT",
                    "side": "RIGHT"
                }
            old_lineno += 1
            new_lineno += 1
        elif line.startswith("-"):
            if content == target_line:
                return {
                    "line": old_lineno,
                    "start_line": hunk_old_start,
                    "start_side": "LEFT",
                    "side": "LEFT",
                }
            old_lineno += 1
        elif line.startswith("+"):
            if content == target_line:
                return {
                    "line": new_lineno,
                    "start_line": hunk_new_start,
                    "start_side": "RIGHT",
                    "side": "RIGHT",
                }
            new_lineno += 1
    return {"line": 1}
```
This utility helps determine the correct line numbers and sides within a diff hunk, which is essential for accurately placing comments on GitHub.

## Running Your Server
With all the files in place, you can now run your FastAPI server.
```sh
fastapi dev main.py
```
To enable GitHub to send webhook requests to your local development server, you'll need a tunneling tool. Install smee-client globally:
```sh
npm install --global smee-client
```
Then, forward your webhook URL to your local port:
```sh
smee -u <webhook-url> -P /webhook -p <port-number>
```
Remember to replace <webhook-url> with the URL you obtained from smee.io and <port-number> with the port your FastAPI application is running on (usually 8000).

## Conclusion
In this blog post, we've walked through the process of creating a GitHub pull request reviewer bot. By leveraging FastAPI for the server, Gemini for AI-powered code review, and a webhook client like smee.io, you can automate a significant part of your code review workflow.
